## New marketing site

### Opening the door to a new demographic of customers

Marketplace's new website has been built from the ground up using modern technologies to ensure both a good developer and user experience. It's integrated with their CRM to make new customer acquisition a doddle.

## Easy-peasy publishing

### A simple and extendable content-focused CMS

The CMS is optimised for content creation with a draft and review system, live editor previews, and custom editor widgets. It allows for the creation of many different content types including landing pages and case studies.

## Lettermark logo

### A nod to the old brand, but looking to the future

A contemporary lettermark with sharp edges that conceptually imbues Marketplace's values and services into the shape. MSS were formally known as Marketplace Communications, the lettermark was chosen over other concepts because it made the rebrand transition smoother.
