intro: >-
  Chorck is revolutionizing training compliance and management in Australia by using clever technology to automate the process for employees, employers, and regulators alike.

  They have complicated backend systems and so they hired me as Lead Designer to create a frontend that bridged to it, masking the complexity, and providing a simple and intuitive experience for their users.
