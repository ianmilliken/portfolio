## Drag & drop student management

### Providing an intuitive way for users to manage their students

I created a drag and drop system to allow business users an easy, intuitive way to assign both their employees and courseware to courses. This allows users a very fast way to create, modify, and keep track of courses.

## Smart suggestive search 

### Helping users to refine large lists of data with minimal effort

Users managing lists of hundreds or thousands of students or courses need a fast way to refine that data. The smart search tool takes a users query and makes weighted suggestions based on the parameters and value they provide.

## Customer activity reporting

### Displaying important metrics with visual clarity

Training company users need a variety of reports to measure the performance of their courseware, and interactions with customers. The activity dashboard automatically generates interactive graphs and charts that allow users to easily digest this information.

## Practical event booking

### An interactive calendar for visualizing and managing large data sets

The calendar allows administrators to see past, present, and upcoming bookings in colour coded bitsize peices. Updating or accessing additional booking information is revealed by clicking on them, and the view can be refined to month, week, or day timelines.

## Microinteractions

### Keeping the UX fun and fresh

Microinteractions are featured throughout Chorck and are built into the design system. They provide positive feedback when the user interacts with the UI, and provide a good baseline for a responsive UX.

## Marketing illustrations

### Giving visual cues to users on how to interact with Chorck’s more complex features

Paying special attention to providing clean, uncluttered layouts, organised and clear typography, and careful usage of colour pallete to frame the websites content were all top priorities.
