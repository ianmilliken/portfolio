I got my first professional gig about 7 years ago, and since then I have been lucky enough to work with all kinds of talented people, on all sorts of projects.

Primarily I work in UI & UX Design and Front End Development, covering everything from wireframes and UAT, to coding and optimisation. I also work in the related disciplines of branding, graphic design, and photography.

I’ve recently relocated to Leeds after 2 years overseas where I was working as the Lead Designer at Chorck, which is a SAAS startup located in Brisbane.

I’m always keen to discuss new opportunuties, so if you’d like to work with me on something please get in touch.
