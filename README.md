# Portfolio PWA

Code for my [portfolio wesbite](https://ianmilliken.netlify.com/). 

Built with Gatsby, with the [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter) repo. Thanks to [Ruben Harutyunyan](https://github.com/Vagr9K) for building such a useful repo, saved me tons of time.

## Getting Started

Ensure Gatsby CLI is installed and then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ianmilliken/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm install
gatsby develop
```
